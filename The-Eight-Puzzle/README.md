Sliding tile puzzles are combinational puzzles that expect the user to move the pieces in a specific path to achieve the desired final result. An example of this would be the 8-puzzle . The 8-puzzle consists of a board containing  8 square tiles and 1 empty spot placed in a 3 by 3 square grid. These tiles are uniquely numbered from 1 to 8. The empty spot allows the player to move the tiles around to get the desired result. You can slide a tile to an empty spot if the empty spot is directly above, below, or next to it. 

This project allowed us to practice using Uniform Cost Search, Misplaced Tile, and Manhattan Distance heuristics. In the documentation, the report will contain the findings I have made throughout the length of the project. In this report I will compare the algorithms, and conclude which one I thought was the most efficient. I decided to use Python for the language of the project, and I have also included the code later in the report provided above.
