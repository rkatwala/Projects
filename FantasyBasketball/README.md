# CS Project Deliverable 

**A**. The complete application use **Factory, Composite, and Stratgey**. The factory is used to create the list of players that the rest of the program relies on by creating Player objects from the text file that was passed in. Composite is used to generate the sub-classes that are composite to the Player Component with the leaves of classes obtaining the individual stats corresponding from the *Rb, Base Def, Ast, FGPercent, and Ppg* classes. The last design pattern that was used was strategy in getting the rating from each player. These were implemented by calling the *Rb, Base Def, Ast, FGPercent, and Ppg* classes which used a different algorithm to rate the players based on the class given to the player.

B. NBA Player Rater

C. App gets data from nba player stats websites, rates the players, and helps make an optimal team. User can then faceoff against two generated user teams to compare the optimal team. The application will also store the user's past teams and allow the user to generate a team from a set roster. 

D. This app helps gather information about nba players to create an optimal fantasy team and helps people learn more about basketball. This will familiarize the user to player stats and compare their favorite player to the set roster.  

E. C++. Stats are obtained from https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/stats

F. The input will be a set of commands prompted by a menu. A roster of user chosen players will be displayed. User will also have the options to display the set roster along with the results from the faceoff command.
